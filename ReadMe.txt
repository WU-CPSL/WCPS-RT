For cases of time-driven control (network reconfiguration case of rate adaptation) and self-triggered control

This is a wireless network-in-the-loop implementation integrating load positioning control system simulated in MATLAB/Simulink Desktop Real-time (SLDRT) and contiki implementation of low power wireless bus (LWB) for real TelosB sky motes. 

Note: this is a initial version. We will keep updating it.

There are three parts of codes:

(1) HIL_MATLAB_time_trigger/HIL_MATLAB_self_trigger: SLDRT is used to simulate the physical part of the WNCS: physical plants, controllers, state observers, and physical disturbance. In practice, industrial plants usually operate continuously or at very high rates (delta_r). However, the wireless communication and controller execute at a relatively low rate (delta_t) because of the communication and computation latencies. Therefore, SLDRT modules are operated at different rates in our design.

(2) lwb_time_trigger/lwb_self_trigger: The 3-floor WSAN testbed is deployed on the 3rd to 5th floors of Jolley Hall at Washington University in St. Louis. It consists of 70 TelosB motes. Each mote is equipped with Chipcon CC2420 radio compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and a TI MSP430 microcontroller. 40 Raspberry Pis with a backplane network are used for the management of the WSAN.

(3) Interfaces: The interfaces between SLDRT and WSAN are  socket connections between the PCs that run SLDRT and the Pis, and serial connections between the Pis and the end nodes.
